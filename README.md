# CS2-Final-Project

3/30/21
In this class, I decided on my app's purpose and what it's supposed to do. My project is an app that helps runners to have better overview of their run. It helps them to log how long they ran as well as where they started, and where they ended. It wil also prompt them to ask what they felt went well during the run, and what went bad, and what they could improve upon in their next run. It will give them their weekly data, and give them their statistics for the week. I also decided on what platform I'm going to use, which is code.org. I planned to having a login feature as well as a graph feature that shows all the data about the runner's run.

In this class, I decided on all the additional features that my app would have. I also looked into a map feature that would help to track the path tat the runner took, and their route. I researched and found a specific module that helps to add a more primitive version of google maps to the app. I am also looking for an accelerometer module that helps me to figure out what speeds the runner is runnign at, and at what time in the run, there pace chnages, either slower or faster. I also began working on the UI and have almost finished designing some of the app's screens.

In this class, I finalized the layout of all my screens, and the general color scheme of my app as well. I drew out all the screens on notability to help myself organize all my plans. Then I began working on the UI for a couple of the app screens such as the Login page, registration page, and the home screen.

In this class, I finished making the UI for the home page, and continued making the UI.

4/19/20
I finished the UI regarding the home screen, and have begun the outline basic coding to move fom screen to screen within the app. I also finished the transition from the login to rgister page, and vice versa. I have also began working on he UI for the page that shows all the runners' past data entries for their runs, and am currently in the process of trying to figure out how tp hook up an accelerometer to the app, so that the app knows how fast the runner has been running, and the change in speeds. I have also finalized the theme and color scheme for the entire app, so now I have a attern that I need to follow with every single screen within the app.
