# CS2-Final-Project

3/30/21
In this class, I decided on my app's purpose and what it's supposed to do. My project is an app that helps runners to have better overview of their run. It helps them to log how long they ran as well as where they started, and where they ended. It wil also prompt them to ask what they felt went well during the run, and what went bad, and what they could improve upon in their next run. It will give them their weekly data, and give them their statistics for the week. I also decided on what platform I'm going to use, which is code.org. I planned to having a login feature as well as a graph feature that shows all the data about the runner's run.

In this class, I decided on all the additional features that my app would have. I also looked into a map feature that would help to track the path tat the runner took, and their route. I researched and found a specific module that helps to add a more primitive version of google maps to the app. I am also looking for an accelerometer module that helps me to figure out what speeds the runner is runnign at, and at what time in the run, there pace chnages, either slower or faster. I also began working on the UI and have almost finished designing some of the app's screens.

4/7/21
In this class, I finalized the layout of all my screens, and the general color scheme of my app as well. I drew out all the screens on notability to help myself organize all my plans. Then I began working on the UI for a couple of the app screens such as the Login page, registration page, and the home screen.

4/12/21
In this class, I finished making the UI for the home page, and continued making the UI.

4/19/21
I finished the UI regarding the home screen, and have begun the outline basic coding to move fom screen to screen within the app. I also finished the transition from the login to register page, and vice versa. I have also began working on he UI for the page that shows all the runners' past data entries for their runs, and am currently in the process of trying to figure out how tp hook up an accelerometer to the app, so that the app knows how fast the runner has been running, and the change in speeds. I have also finalized the theme and color scheme for the entire app, so now I have a attern that I need to follow with every single screen within the app.

I began working on the login and registration features for my app. I was, doing this by running all the user inputs throught the records in the data table. If the account is not in the data table, it will prompt the user to create an account or to retype their username or password as they might have got it wrong.

4/23/21
I was working on the login feature, and was able to get the Username check, to function. However, when I tried to get the regustration code to woprl, there was a small bug in the code which I was not able to figure out. 

4/27/21
I fnally figured out the bug that did not allow the registration function on my app to work. Instead of creating 2 separate arguments in 2 colums, I had been createing thos arguments in sperate rows, so when one argument was assigned to a column, the other argument automatically became "undefined".

4/28/21
I began working on the acceleration feature on my app. I figured out how to use the Adafruit circuit that was becessary for me to use the acceleration feature. 

4/30/31 
I figured out how I was going to use the adafruit circuit, and incorporate it into my product. I was originally planning on attaching it  to the back of a phone using magnets or velcro. After doing frther research however, I found that it may be more efficient for the user to have the circuit on themselves as a watch. All I need to do is find 2 pieces of smooth velcro to create my product. 

5/4/21
I created my data tables, and decided how I was going to organize all the acceleration speeds that app will be getting from the circuit. Ever minute, the ciorcuit is top pick up the runner's speed and add the speed to the data table. Once the run is done, the circuit will stop gettong the speeds, and will add up all the speeds in order to find an average speed that the runner was running at.

5/6/21
I created a new screen to start the user's run, and to start picking up speeds. I decided it woulkd be better for my program to run if the play button's color changed, and THEN the program started running. To stop the run, you would press the play button again, and the button's color would revert from red back to the usual turquoise color that is present all throughout the app's color scheme. 

5/9/21 
I am almost done with the acceleration feature, however I just need to incorporate the circuit into the program once I get to schoo tomorrow so that I can make sure that the festure is 100% functional.
